Add neccessary dependencies in pom.xml file. In this google-cloud-vision - artifact is necessary for detecting labels. 

After that create application jsp pages and their corresponding servlets.
index.jsp: This page allows to upload image to the application.
The Upload.java servlet gets the requests. 



**index.jsp** - This Allows us to upload an image.

**Upload.java** - It is a servlet that gets the request. After receiving the request, the image is converted to blobbytes. BLOB allows us to manage the creation and serving of large, immutable blobs to users. After that it is processed in the method getImageLabels() in order to to fetch the image labels  by using the Google CV api. The fetched label results are then redirected to the view using labels.jsp

**Google Blobstore** - 

com.google.appengine.api.blobstore
BLOB - Binary Large OBject.BLOB is a collection of binary data that is stored as a single entity.
